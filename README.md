# Updated AAA 

This is an updated version of the **Automatic Analysis Architecture (AAA)** tool originally published by Malfante, Mars & Della Mura (2018) (available at [GitHub](https://github.com/malfante/AAA) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/1216028)). This enhanced version introduces significant improvements and new features designed to optimize analysis workflows and extend functionality.

The Updated AAA (UAAA) is a tool for building and implementing a classification model based on machine learning to analyse continuous time series. We've developped it for the automatic classification of seismo-volcanic signals at the Popocatépetl volcano in Mexico, but can be adapted to analyse other types of signals. 

## Featured Updates:
- Implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space proposed in the original AAA workflow.  
- Inclusion of performance metrics per class during cross-validation and testing of the classification model.  
- Introduction of a dynamic-sized window for the analysis of continuous recordings.  
- Enhanced visualization tools for improved data interpretation and insights.

The original peer-reviewed paper for which the Updated AAA (UAAA) workflow was developped is:
